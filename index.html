							In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups.
							The police who investigate crime and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories.

							Look for the Union Label when you are buying a coat, dress, or blouse. Remember, somewhere our union's sewing,
							our wages going to feed the kids, and run the house. We work hard, but who's complaining. Thanks to the I.L.G.
							we're paying our way. So always look for the Union Label. It means we're able to make it in the U.S.A.!

							I am Duncan Macleod, born 400 years ago in the Highlands of Scotland. I am Immortal, and I am not alone.
							For centuries, we have waited for the time of the Gathering when the stroke of a sword and the fall of a
							head will release the power of the Quickening. In the end, there can be only one.
